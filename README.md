# 📊 HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project analyzes employee attrition (turnover) using a common industry dataset, leveraging **advanced Excel features** to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard.

The goal was to move beyond simple headcounts to identify high risk demographic and role segments, providing actionable insights for retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Methodology and Key Metrics

The analysis demonstrates proficiency in data transformation and analytical feature engineering:

### 1. Feature Engineering (Data Transformation)
Before analysis, the raw data was enhanced to create meaningful analytical features (derived columns) that enable deeper insights:

* **Age Bracket:** Categorizing age groups for targeted retention programs.
* **Experience Level:** Classifying employee seniority based on years of experience.
* **Tenure Ratio:** Calculating an employee's time at the company relative to total experience.

### 2. Core Metrics and KPIs
The dashboard provides immediate visibility into the company's health:

* **Total Employees** and **Total Attrition Count**.
* **Overall Attrition Rate (%)**: The core KPI for measuring turnover.

## 🔎 Analytical Findings (Dashboard Insights)

The interactive dashboard (titled "IBM Workforce Analytics Dashboard" in the visual) uses **Slicers** to allow managers to instantly filter the data, revealing key problem areas:

* **High-Risk Segments:** Analysis identified significant variation in **Attrition Rate (%)** across different **Job Roles** and **Departments**.
* **Demographic Drivers:** The dashboard allows cross-tabulation of attrition rates against factors like **Marital Status** and **Age Bracket** to isolate vulnerable employee populations.
* **Visualization:** Charts clearly visualize attrition rates by Job Role, Department, and Marital Status, making complex patterns easy to interpret.
