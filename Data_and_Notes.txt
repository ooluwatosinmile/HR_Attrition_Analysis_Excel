--- HR ATTRITION ANALYSIS TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION ---

This file documents the data cleaning and feature engineering steps performed in Excel, serving as proof of advanced data manipulation and modeling proficiency.

1. DATA CLEANING AND VALIDATION:
- Verified data integrity across all 35 columns and 1,470 employee records.
- Standardized text entries (e.g., ensuring all "Research & Development" entries were consistent).
- Confirmed 'Attrition' column (Yes/No) was correctly formatted for KPI calculations.

2. FEATURE ENGINEERING (ADVANCED CALCULATIONS):
The following calculated features were added to the dataset to enable deeper multivariate analysis, which were key to the dashboard's effectiveness:

A. AGE BRACKET: Categorized employee age (e.g., "18-25", "26-35", "35-45", "46-55", "56 and above").
   - Purpose: To isolate if attrition risk changes significantly by age.

B. EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Categorized based on 'YearsAtCompany' and 'TotalWorkingYears'.
   - Purpose: To identify flight risk among mid-level employees vs. long-term veterans.

C. TENURE RATIO: Calculated as (YearsAtCompany / TotalWorkingYears).
   - Purpose: Measures the proportion of an employee's career spent at the current company. A low ratio can indicate a high turnover history.

3. KPI CALCULATION:
- Attrition Rate % was calculated as (SUM(Attrition="Yes") / COUNT(EmployeeID)). This rate was the primary metric used in all dashboard visuals.
